You will provide to us (using the processes and timing that we designate) any requested information regarding shipment, tracking (to the extent available) and order status, and we may make any of this information publicly available.

                  <h3>4.CART IN HOUR's Role.</h3>

                      <li>CARTINHOUR provides a platform for third-party sellers ("Sellers") and buyers ("Buyers") to negotiate and complete transactions.</li>
                      <li>CARTINHOUR is not involved in the actual transaction between Sellers and Buyers, buyer buys product from the seller at the price which is fixed by the seller and we (CARTINHOUR) delivers that product to the customers.</li>
                      <li>As a Seller, you may list any item on the Site unless it is a prohibited item as defined in the procedures and guidelines contained in the Help section, or otherwise prohibited by law.</li>
                      <li>Without limitation, you may not list any item or link or post any related material that (a) infringes any third-party intellectual property rights (including copyright, trademark, patent, and trade secrets) or other proprietary rights (including rights of publicity or privacy); (b) constitutes libel or slander or is otherwise defamatory; or (c) is counterfeited, illegal, stolen, or fraudulent.</li>
                      <li>It is up to the Seller to accurately describe the item for sale. As a Seller, you use the Site and the Services at your own risk</li>
                  </ul>
                  <h3>5.The Transaction Processing Service.</h3>
                  <ul>
                    <li> By registering for or using the Services, you authorize CARTINHOUR Payments, to act as your agent for purposes of processing payments, refunds and adjustments for Your Transactions (as defined below), receiving and holding Sales Proceeds (as defined below) on your behalf, remitting Sales Proceeds to your bank account, charging your credit card, and paying CARTINHOUR and its affiliates amounts you owe in accordance with this Participation Agreement or other agreements you may have with CARTINHOUR or its affiliates (collectively, the "Transaction Processing Service").</li>
                    <li>"Sales gross" means the gross proceeds from any of Your Transactions, including all shipping and handling, gift wrap and other charges, but excluding any taxes separately stated and charged. "Your Transaction" means any sale of your items through the Site. As used, "we," "us" and "our" mean CARTINHOUR Payments. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Participation Agreement, CARTINHOUR may in its discretion perform the Transaction Processing Services.</li>
                    <li>The Transaction Processing Service facilitates the purchase of Seller items listed on the Site. Sales gross are credited to a registered Seller's Payment Account and funds are periodically transferred to the Seller's designated bank account ("Seller's Account"). When a Buyer instructs us to pay you, you agree that the Buyer authorizes and orders us to commit the Buyer's payment to you (less any applicable fees or other amounts we may collect under this Participation Agreement).</li>
                    <li>You agree that Buyers satisfy their obligations to you for Your Transactions when we receive the Sales Proceeds. Our obligation to remit funds received by us on your behalf is limited to funds that we have received less amounts owed to CARTINHOUR, subject to chargeback or reversal or withheld for anticipated claims in accordance with this Participation Agreement.</li>
                    <li>The Transaction Processing Service helps facilitate Your Transactions and neither we nor our affiliates are the purchaser of the Seller's goods.</li>
                    <li>Seller will resolve any dispute directly with Buyer or with the assistance of the CIH (CARTINHOUR.com) Guarantee and not through the Transaction Processing Service.</li>
                    <li>You must provide us true and accurate information when registering and must maintain and update that information as applicable. </li>
                    <li>We may at any time require you to provide any financial, business or personal information we request to verify your identity. Seller will not impersonate any person or use a name he or she is not legally authorized to use.</li>
                    <li>Seller authorizes us to verify his or her information (including any updated information), to obtain credit reports about Seller to approve Seller for use of the Transaction Processing Service and from time to time while Seller is registered with The  CARTINHOUR Payments Privacy Notice applies to your use of the Transaction Processing Service.\\]\The Transaction Processing Service is generally available seven (7) days per week, twenty-four (8) hours per day(10am-6pm), except for scheduled downtime due to system maintenance. </li>
                    <li>We can initiate credits to Seller's Account only on a Business Day when the automated clearinghouses are open for business. For purposes of this Participation Agreement, a "Business Day" is a Monday through Friday, excluding federal banking holidays. </li>

You may not create invoices for Your Transactions.</li>
                    <li>All balances for a given 7-day period will be reflected in the Payment Account summary. We will initiate a credit to Seller's Account on a rolling 7-day cycle ("Payment Date") based on the original date of Seller's registration with the Service or on the next Business Day if the scheduled Payment Date falls on a non-Business Day. If Seller requests a change to the scheduled Payment Date, the 7-day cycle will be reset to the requested Payment Date.</li>
                    <li>When you either initially provide or later change your bank account information, you must wait 7 days to request a transfer to Seller's Account. After 7 days, you may request transfers to Seller's Account.</li>
                    <li>We will initiate a transfer to Seller's Account on each Payment Date and, initiate a transfer to Seller's Account for the total amount of Sales gross you received from Buyers' authorized payment, less any fees or other amounts we may collect under this Participation Agreement, any refunds, adjustments, or other amounts paid to Buyers about Your Transactions, or for funds you otherwise received since the last Payment Date.</li>
                    <li>The amount of the fees for the Services will be posted to Seller's Payment Account and will be deducted from the balance of credits in the Seller's Payment Account to be remitted to you on the next Payment Date. </li>
                    <li>Without limiting CARTINHOUR Payments' rights to collect any amounts you owe, including as described in this Participation Agreement, CARTINHOUR Payments' receipt of Sales Proceeds discharges your obligation to pay applicable fees and other amounts under this Participation Agreement to the extent the Sales Proceeds equal or exceed the fees and other amounts you owe and the Sales Proceeds are applied to the payment of those fees and amounts.</li>
                    <li>Transfers to the Seller's Account will generally be credited within seven Business Days of the date we initiate the transfer. On occasion, we may send Seller a paper check instead of an electronic credit to Seller's Account. We will do so, for instance, if Seller's bank will not accept an electronic credit to Seller's Account</li>
                    <li>As a security measure, we or our affiliates may, but are not required to, impose transaction limits on some or all Buyers and Sellers relating to the value of any transaction, disbursement, or adjustment, the cumulative value of all transactions, disbursements, or adjustments during a period of time, or the number of transactions per day or other period of time. </li>
                    <li>• Neither we nor our affiliates will be liable to Seller: (i) if we do not proceed with a transaction, disbursement, or adjustment that would exceed any limit established by us or our affiliates for a security reason, or (ii) if we or our affiliates permit a Buyer to withdraw from a transaction because the Transaction   Processing Service is unavailable following the commencement of a transaction.</li>
                    <li>If we or our affiliates reasonably conclude based on information available to us or our affiliates that Seller's actions and/or performance in connection with the Services may result in Buyer disputes, chargebacks or other claims, then we may, in our sole discretion, delay initiating any remittances and withhold any payments to be made or that are otherwise due to you in connection with the Services or this Participation Agreement until the completion of any investigation(s) regarding any Seller actions and/or performance in connection with this Participation Agreement. We will not be liable to Seller if we act in accordance with the provisions of this Section.</li>
                    <li>All notices will be sent by e-mail or will be posted on the Site or by any other means then specified by us or CARTINHOUR. </li>
                    <li>• We will send notices to Seller at the e-mail address maintained in our or CARTINHOUR 's records for Seller.

Seller will send notices to us using the functionality for contacting CARTINHOUR provided in our Help pages.</li>
                    <li>We may refuse service to anyone for any reason. We will bear the risk of credit card or bank account fraud (i.e., fraudulent purchase arising from the theft and unauthorized use of a third party's credit card or bank account information) occurring in connection with Your Transactions, and Seller will bear all other risk of fraud or loss; provided, that we will not bear the risk of credit card or bank account fraud in connection with any of Seller's products (except those products, if any, that are fulfilled using the Fulfilment by CARTINHOUR service) that are not fulfilled strictly in accordance with the order information and shipping information that CARTINHOUR provides you.</li>
                    <li>CARTINHOUR reserves the right to seek reimbursement from Seller if CARTINHOUR, in its sole discretion, decide to reimburse Buyer under the terms of the CARTINHOUR.com Guarantee, provide a refund to Buyer if Seller cannot promptly deliver the goods, discover erroneous or duplicate transactions, or receive a chargeback from Buyer's credit card issuer for the amount of Buyer's purchase from Seller.</li>
                    <li>We may obtain reimbursement of any amounts owed by Seller to CARTINHOUR or us by deducting from future payments owed to Seller, reversing any credits to Seller's Account, charging against gift certificates held in Seller's Account (if any) that were purchased with Sales Proceeds, charging Seller's credit card or bank account, or seeking such reimbursement from Seller by any other lawful means. You authorize us to use any or all the foregoing methods to seek reimbursement, including the debiting of your credit card or bank account.</li>
